Test Authenticator Plug-in
==========================

     :target: https://travis-ci.org/curityio/test-authenticator

This project provides an opens source Test Authenticator plug-in for the Curity Identity Server.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Curity Identity Server 3.0.0 and `its system requirements <https://developer.curity.io/docs/latest/system-admin-guide/system-requirements.html>`_

Requirements for Building from Source
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Maven 3
* Java JDK v. 8

Compiling the Plug-in from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source is very easy to compile. To do so from a shell, issue this command: ``mvn package``.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install this plug-in, either download a binary version available from the `releases section of this project's GitHub repository <https://github.com/curityio/test-authenticator/releases>`_ or compile it from source (as described above). If you compiled the plug-in from source, the package will be placed in the ``target`` subdirectory. The resulting JAR file or the one downloaded from GitHub needs to placed in the directory ``${IDSVR_HOME}/usr/share/plugins/test``. (The name of the last directory, ``test``, which is the plug-in group, is arbitrary and can be anything.) After doing so, the plug-in will become available as soon as the node is restarted.

.. note::

    The JAR file needs to be deployed to each run-time node and the admin node. For simple test deployments where the admin node is a run-time node, the JAR file only needs to be copied to one location.

For a more detailed explanation of installing plug-ins, refer to the `Curity developer guide <https://developer.curity.io/docs/latest/developer-guide/plugins/index.html#plugin-installation>`_.


Creating a Test Authenticator in Curity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to configure a new Test authenticator is using the Curity admin UI. The configuration for this can be downloaded as XML or CLI commands later, so only the steps to do this in the GUI will be described.

1. Go to the ``Authenticators`` page of the authentication profile wherein the authenticator instance should be created.
2. Click the ``New Authenticator`` button.
3. Enter a name (e.g., ``test1``). This name needs to match the URI component in the callback URI set in the Test app.
4. For the type, pick the ``Test`` option: and click Next.
5. On the next page, you can define the optional username.

Once all of these changes are made, they will be staged, but not committed (i.e., not running). To make them active, click the ``Commit`` menu option in the ``Changes`` menu. Optionally enter a comment in the ``Deploy Changes`` dialogue and click ``OK``.

Once the configuration is committed and running, the authenticator can be used like any other.
